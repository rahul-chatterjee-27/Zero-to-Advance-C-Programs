# 🧠 Basic C Programs

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly C programs designed to build foundational programming skills. Each file in this repo demonstrates a basic concept or utility in C programming, such as arithmetic operations, data type usage, swapping logic, and conversions.

📂 Folder Overview (C Programming)
#Basic
🔸 Simple C programs covering input/output, variables, and operators.
#Array
🔸 Programs on 1D and 2D arrays with insertion, deletion, and traversal logic.
#Conditional
🔸 if, else, nested if, and switch case-based decision-making examples.
#Loop
🔸 Usage of for, while, and do-while loops to solve repetitive tasks.
#Function
🔸 Covers user-defined functions, return types, and function calling mechanisms.
#Pointer
🔸 Programs to understand pointer basics, arithmetic, and pointer to pointer concepts.
#Recursion
🔸 Recursive solutions like factorial, sum of digits, and Fibonacci series.
#String
🔸 String handling using character arrays and standard functions like strlen, strcpy.
#Logical
🔸 Logical puzzles and pattern-printing programs for improving logic-building.
#File Handling
🔸 Working with files — reading, writing, and appending using file I/O functions.
#Structure & Union
🔸 Demonstrates usage of struct and union for handling complex data types.
