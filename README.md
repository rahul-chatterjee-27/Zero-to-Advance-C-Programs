# üß† Basic C Programs

A well-organized C programming collection with topic-wise folders covering basics, arrays, conditionals, loops, functions, pointers, strings, recursion, files, structures, and logic-building. This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly C programs designed to build foundational programming skills. Each file in this repo demonstrates a basic concept or utility in C programming, such as arithmetic operations, data type usage, swapping logic, and conversions.

This C programming repository is organized into topic-wise folders for easy learning and practice. It covers Basic programs for I/O and variables, Arrays (1D/2D operations), Conditional statements like if and switch, and all types of Loops. It also includes Functions, Pointers, and Recursion examples such as factorial and Fibonacci. You'll find String handling using standard functions, Logical problems and patterns, File Handling with read/write operations, and examples of Structure & Union for managing complex data types. Ideal for students, beginners, and interview prep.
